# Personal Blog Web APIs Challenge
Module 4 Challenge


## User Story
As a marketing student, I want a personal blog so that I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a personal blog,
- **When** I load the app,
  - **Then** I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
- **When** I submit the form,
  - **Then** blog post data is stored to localStorage.
- **When** the form submits,
  - **Then** I am redirected to the posts page.
- **When** I try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
  - **Then** I am presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.
- **When** I view the posts page,
  - **Then** I am presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
- **When** I click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
  - **Then** the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
- **When** I click the "Back" button,
  - **Then** I am redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
- **When** I view the main content,
  - **Then** I am presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
- **When** I view localStorage,
  - **Then** I am presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
- **When** I take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
  - **Then** I can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
- **When** I view the footer,
  - **Then** I am presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
